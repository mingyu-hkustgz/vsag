## What is VSAG

VSAG is a vector indexing library used for similarity search. The indexing algorithm allows users to search through various sizes of vector sets, especially those that cannot fit in memory. The library also provides methods for generating parameters based on vector dimensions and data scale, allowing developers to use it without understanding the algorithm’s principles. VSAG is written in C++ and provides a Python wrapper package called [pyvsag](https://pypi.org/project/pyvsag/).

## Performance
The VSAG algorithm achieves a significant boost of efficiency and outperforms the previous **state-of-the-art (SOTA)** by a clear margin. Specifically, VSAG's QPS exceeds that of the previous SOTA algorithm, Glass, by over 100%, and the baseline algorithm, HNSWLIB, by over 300% according to the ann-benchmark result on the GIST dataset at 90% recall.
The test in [ann-benchmarks](https://ann-benchmarks.com/) is running on an r6i.16xlarge machine on AWS with `--parallelism 31`, single-CPU, and hyperthreading disabled.
The result is as follows:

abstract = {Searching for approximate nearest neighbors (ANN) in the high-dimensional Euclidean space is a pivotal problem. Recently, with the help of fast SIMD-based implementations, Product Quantization (PQ) and its variants can often efficiently and accurately estimate the distances between the vectors and have achieved great success in the in-memory ANN search. Despite their empirical success, we note that these methods do not have a theoretical error bound and are observed to fail disastrously on some real-world datasets. Motivated by this, we propose a new randomized quantization method named RaBitQ, which quantizes D-dimensional vectors into D-bit strings. RaBitQ guarantees a sharp theoretical error bound and provides good empirical accuracy at the same time. In addition, we introduce efficient implementations of RaBitQ, supporting to estimate the distances with bitwise operations or SIMD-based operations. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets confirm that (1) our method outperforms PQ and its variants in terms of accuracy-efficiency trade-off by a clear margin and (2) its empirical performance is well-aligned with our theoretical analysis.},
